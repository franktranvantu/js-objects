Arrays let you group values to build complex data structures. 

With an array, you store a collection of elements you can access by their position (or index). 

Objects take that concept further by providing a way to structure related data that's easy to read and retrieve using key/value pairs. 

It's common to combine the two by creating an array of objects.
